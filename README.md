# C++
1. This repository is the basic things for C++  
2. In here, the following issues are displayed in the code file:  
* Variables  
* Types of variables  
* Downloading data from the input  
* Arithmetic and Assigment Operators
```c++
// iostream stands for input output stream
#include <iostream>
main ()
{
  //cout stands for Console Output, "this is test" will be sent to the Console Output
  cout << "this is test";
}
```
**This won't be able to run cause "cout" is inside a namespace, you need to add "using namespace" or "std::", see the following code:**    
## __Add "using namespace"__
```c++
// iostream stands for input output stream
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

main ()
{
  //cout stands for Console Output, "this is test" will be sent to the Console Output
  cout << "this is test";
}
```  
## __Add "std::" in front of the cout__
```c++
// iostream stands for input output stream
#include <iostream>

main ()
{
  //cout stands for Console Output, "this is test" will be sent to the Console Output
  std:: cout << "this is test";
}
```
**Now you can run your code :)**
